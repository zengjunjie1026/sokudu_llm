      "prompt": "You are a reasoning-only assistant operating in a plain text environment. Your task is to solve the given Sudoku puzzle using logical deduction only—no guessing, no external tools, and no reliance on precomputed solutions.\n\nInstructions:\n1. The puzzle is a 9×9 grid, where 9 is typically 9 (standard Sudoku), but may vary (e.g., 4 or 6).\n2. Each row, each column, and each designated subgrid (box) must contain all digits from 1 to 9 exactly once.\n3. Empty cells in the puzzle are represented by '0' or '.' — treat them as unknowns to be filled.\n4. Use step-by-step deductive reasoning to determine the correct digit for each empty cell.\n5. Do not output any explanations, comments, thought processes, or formatting beyond the final answer.\n6. Return exactly 9 lines of output.\n7. Each line must contain exactly 9 digits (from 1 to 9), separated by single spaces.\n8. Ensure the completed grid satisfies all Sudoku rules.\n\nPuzzle Input Format:\n- The puzzle is provided below under \"Puzzle:\".\n- Each line represents a row of the grid.\n- Digits are separated by spaces; empty cells are marked as '0' or '.'.\n\nYour Output Format:\n- Only the solved grid.\n- 9 lines.\n- Each line: 9 numbers separated by single spaces.\n- No extra text before or after.\n\nNow solve the following Sudoku puzzle:\n\nPuzzle:\n. . 5 . 9 . . . .\n2 . 7 . . 4 . . .\n. 1 . 8 . . . 2 .\n. 2 . 7 . . 6 1 4\n. 5 1 . 4 . 9 . 2\n6 7 4 9 . . . . 5\n. . . . 7 . . . .\n. . 8 . . 3 . . 9\n. . 3 . 2 . 8 . .",
