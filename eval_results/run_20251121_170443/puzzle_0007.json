      "prompt": "You are a reasoning-only assistant operating in a plain text environment. Your task is to solve the given Sudoku puzzle using logical deduction only—no guessing, no external tools, and no reliance on precomputed solutions.\n\nInstructions:\n1. The puzzle is a 9×9 grid, where 9 is typically 9 (standard Sudoku), but may vary (e.g., 4 or 6).\n2. Each row, each column, and each designated subgrid (box) must contain all digits from 1 to 9 exactly once.\n3. Empty cells in the puzzle are represented by '0' or '.' — treat them as unknowns to be filled.\n4. Use step-by-step deductive reasoning to determine the correct digit for each empty cell.\n5. Do not output any explanations, comments, thought processes, or formatting beyond the final answer.\n6. Return exactly 9 lines of output.\n7. Each line must contain exactly 9 digits (from 1 to 9), separated by single spaces.\n8. Ensure the completed grid satisfies all Sudoku rules.\n\nPuzzle Input Format:\n- The puzzle is provided below under \"Puzzle:\".\n- Each line represents a row of the grid.\n- Digits are separated by spaces; empty cells are marked as '0' or '.'.\n\nYour Output Format:\n- Only the solved grid.\n- 9 lines.\n- Each line: 9 numbers separated by single spaces.\n- No extra text before or after.\n\nNow solve the following Sudoku puzzle:\n\nPuzzle:\n. 7 . 3 . 1 9 6 .\n. 5 . . 4 . 3 7 .\n. . . . . 7 . . 1\n. . . . . 2 . 9 .\n4 2 . 9 . . . . .\n. . 7 . . 4 1 5 2\n8 3 . . . . . . .\n7 . . 4 2 3 . . 5\n1 . . . . . . . 6",

Let's recompute final grid from solved steps.\n\nHold on I realize mistake: row1 earlier solved as 2 7 8 3 5 7? Wait column6 row1 is 9. Let's reconstruct final grid from solved states:\n\nRow1: 2 7 8 3 5 7? Wait column6 row1=9. So row1: 2 7 8 3 5 9 9? Wait duplicate. Let's re-evaluate final grid from earlier steps.\n\nLet's reconstruct from final solved states:\n\nRow1: 2 7 8 3 5 9 9? Wait column7 row1=9 yes. So row1: 2 7 8 3 5 9 9 6 4 -> but duplicate 9. Wait we mis-saw earlier: column7 row1=9 correct; column6 row1=9? Wait row1 column6 is 9? yes row1 had 9 at column7? Wait check: original row1 had 9 at column7; column6 was 6? Wait row1: after solving we had row1: 2 7 8 3 5 9 9 6 4? Wait column6 row1 originally 6? Wait check: initial row1: 2 7 0 3 0 0 9 6 4. After solving we set c3=8, c5=5, leaving column6? row1 column6 remained 0? Wait row1 column6 originally 0? yes row1 had 0 at column6? Wait row1 had 0 at column6? Wait row1 had 0 at column6? Actually row1 had 0 at column6? Wait row1 originally: \"2 7 0 3 0 0 9 6 4\". yes column6 was 0. After solving we set column5=5, column3=8, leaving column6 still 0? Wait we didn't set column6 earlier. But later we might have set column6? Wait check: column6 values after solving: column6 values: row1=0, row2=9, row3=7, row4=2, row5=5, row6=4, row7=0, row8=3, row9=0 -> missing numbers {1,6,8}. r1c6? from earlier we had 0? but row1 column6 originally 0; but after solving we might have set? Wait we didn't set column6 earlier. But later we solved column6? Wait we solved column6 when column6 column had values 0,9,7,2,5,4,0,3,0 -> missing numbers {1,6,8}. r1c6? {??}. Wait we didn't compute earlier. Let's recompute from scratch final grid after all steps.\n\nLet's reconstruct from final solved states step by step:\n\nAfter solving, we had:\n\nRow1: 2 7 8 3 5 9? Wait check column6 row1 maybe 9? Wait column6 column after solving had values: row1=?, row2=9, row3=7, row4=2, row5=5, row6=4, row7=0, row8=3, row9=0. We solved column6 later? we set r2c6=9 earlier, r5c6=5, r7c6=6? Wait r7c6=6 earlier. After solving column6 we had r2c6=9, r5c6=5, r7c6=6, r9c6=8? Wait we set r9c6=8 earlier. So column6 final values: row1=?, row2=9, row3=7, row4=2, row5=5, row6=4, row7=6, row8=3, row9=8 -> missing numbers {1}. So r1c6=1. Good! So row1 becomes 2 7 8 3 5 1 9 6 4. yes.\n\nThus final grid:\n\nRow1: 2 7 8 3 5 1 9 6 4\nRow2: 6 5 1 2 4 9 3 7 8\nRow3: 3 9 4 8 6 7 5 2 1\nRow4: 5 1 6 7 8 2 4 9 3\nRow5: 4 2 3 9 1 5 6 8 7\nRow6: 9 8 7 6 3 4 1 5 2\nRow7: 8 3 5 1 7 6 2 4 9\nRow8: 7 6 9 4 2 3 8 1 5\nRow9: 1 4 2 5 9 8 7 3 6\n\nCheck each row/column: all good.2 7 8 3 5 1 9 6 4\n6 5 1 2 4 9 3 7 8\n3 9 4 8 6 7 5 2 1\n5 1 6 7 8 2 4 9 3\n4 2 3 9 1 5 6 8 7\n9 8 7 6 3 4 1 5 2\n8 3 5 1 7 6 2 4 9\n7 6 9 4 2 3 8 1 5\n1 4 2 5 9 8 7 3 6",
