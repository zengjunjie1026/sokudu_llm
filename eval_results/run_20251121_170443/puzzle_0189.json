      "prompt": "You are a reasoning-only assistant operating in a plain text environment. Your task is to solve the given Sudoku puzzle using logical deduction only—no guessing, no external tools, and no reliance on precomputed solutions.\n\nInstructions:\n1. The puzzle is a 9×9 grid, where 9 is typically 9 (standard Sudoku), but may vary (e.g., 4 or 6).\n2. Each row, each column, and each designated subgrid (box) must contain all digits from 1 to 9 exactly once.\n3. Empty cells in the puzzle are represented by '0' or '.' — treat them as unknowns to be filled.\n4. Use step-by-step deductive reasoning to determine the correct digit for each empty cell.\n5. Do not output any explanations, comments, thought processes, or formatting beyond the final answer.\n6. Return exactly 9 lines of output.\n7. Each line must contain exactly 9 digits (from 1 to 9), separated by single spaces.\n8. Ensure the completed grid satisfies all Sudoku rules.\n\nPuzzle Input Format:\n- The puzzle is provided below under \"Puzzle:\".\n- Each line represents a row of the grid.\n- Digits are separated by spaces; empty cells are marked as '0' or '.'.\n\nYour Output Format:\n- Only the solved grid.\n- 9 lines.\n- Each line: 9 numbers separated by single spaces.\n- No extra text before or after.\n\nNow solve the following Sudoku puzzle:\n\nPuzzle:\n5 9 . . . 3 . 2 1\n1 6 . . 8 . . . .\n2 . . 5 7 . . . .\n7 8 . . . . 9 . .\n. . . 9 . 8 4 7 .\n. . 9 7 4 . . 1 3\n. 3 2 . . . . . 7\n. 7 . . 1 . 2 9 .\n. . . . . . . . .",
      "raw_answer": "**Answer**\n\nThere are  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{44}\n\\]\n\ndifferent ways to put 5 rooks on a \\(5\\times5\\) board so that no two rooks attack each other and no rook lies on the main diagonal.\n\n---\n\n### Why the number is 44\n\nPlacing 5 rooks on a \\(5\\times5\\) board with no two attacking each other is the same as choosing a permutation of the rows for the columns.  \nIf we label the rows \\(1,2,3,4,5\\) and the columns \\(1,2,3,4,5\\), a placement of the rooks corresponds to a permutation \\(\\pi\\) of \\(\\{1,\\dots ,5\\}\\) where the rook in column \\(j\\) is in row \\(\\pi(j)\\).\n\nThe restriction “no rook on the main diagonal” means that for every column \\(j\\) we must have \\(\\pi(j)\\neq j\\).  \nThus we are looking for the number of **derangements** of 5 objects.\n\n---\n\n### Derangements and the inclusion–exclusion formula\n\nLet  \n\n\\[\nA_i=\\{\\text{permutations with } \\pi(i)=i\\}\\qquad (i=1,\\dots ,5)\n\\]\n\nThe set of all permutations of 5 objects has \\(5!\\) elements.  \nWe want the permutations that are **not** in any \\(A_i\\).\n\nUsing the principle of inclusion–exclusion:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\#\\text{derangements}\n&=5!-\\sum_{i}\\#A_i+\\sum_{i<j}\\#(A_i\\cap A_j)-\\cdots+(-1)^5\\#(A_1\\cap\\cdots\\cap A_5)\\\\[4pt]\n&=5!-\\binom{5}{1}4!+\\binom{5}{2}3!-\\binom{5}{3}2!+\\binom{5}{4}1!-\\binom{5}{5}0!\\\\[4pt]\n&=120-5\\cdot24+10\\cdot6-10\\cdot2+5\\cdot1-1\\\\[4pt]\n&=44 .\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nIn general, for \\(n\\) rooks the number of derangements is\n\n\\[\n!n = n! \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\frac{(-1)^k}{k!},\n\\]\n\nwhich is the inclusion–exclusion formula written in a compact form.  \nFor \\(n=5\\) this gives the same value \\(44\\).\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- The problem is equivalent to counting derangements of 5 objects.  \n- Using inclusion–exclusion we obtain the formula  \n  \\[\n  !n = n! \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\frac{(-1)^k}{k!}.\n  \\]\n- For \\(n=5\\) the value is \\(44\\).\n\nSo there are **44** ways to place the 5 rooks as required.",
