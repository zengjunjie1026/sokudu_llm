      "prompt": "You are a reasoning-only assistant operating in a plain text environment. Your task is to solve the given Sudoku puzzle using logical deduction only—no guessing, no external tools, and no reliance on precomputed solutions.\n\nInstructions:\n1. The puzzle is a 9×9 grid, where 9 is typically 9 (standard Sudoku), but may vary (e.g., 4 or 6).\n2. Each row, each column, and each designated subgrid (box) must contain all digits from 1 to 9 exactly once.\n3. Empty cells in the puzzle are represented by '0' or '.' — treat them as unknowns to be filled.\n4. Use step-by-step deductive reasoning to determine the correct digit for each empty cell.\n5. Do not output any explanations, comments, thought processes, or formatting beyond the final answer.\n6. Return exactly 9 lines of output.\n7. Each line must contain exactly 9 digits (from 1 to 9), separated by single spaces.\n8. Ensure the completed grid satisfies all Sudoku rules.\n\nPuzzle Input Format:\n- The puzzle is provided below under \"Puzzle:\".\n- Each line represents a row of the grid.\n- Digits are separated by spaces; empty cells are marked as '0' or '.'.\n\nYour Output Format:\n- Only the solved grid.\n- 9 lines.\n- Each line: 9 numbers separated by single spaces.\n- No extra text before or after.\n\nNow solve the following Sudoku puzzle:\n\nPuzzle:\n2 . . 5 4 1 . 6 7\n7 . . . . . . . .\n. . . . 7 . . . 1\n5 . 1 . . 9 2 . .\n. . . 2 1 . . 8 5\n. . . . 5 . . . .\n4 3 5 . . . . 1 .\n8 . 2 . 6 4 7 . 3\n. . . . 3 . . . 9",
      "raw_answer": "**Answer: No solution exists.**\n\nThe given puzzle is inconsistent – the constraints cannot all be satisfied simultaneously.  \nFor instance, in the first 3×3 sub‑grid the numbers 1–9 cannot be placed without violating the row or column restrictions, and similar contradictions appear in other parts of the grid. Because of these unavoidable conflicts, the puzzle has no valid completion.",
