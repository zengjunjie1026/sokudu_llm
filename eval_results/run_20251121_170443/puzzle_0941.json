      "prompt": "You are a reasoning-only assistant operating in a plain text environment. Your task is to solve the given Sudoku puzzle using logical deduction only—no guessing, no external tools, and no reliance on precomputed solutions.\n\nInstructions:\n1. The puzzle is a 9×9 grid, where 9 is typically 9 (standard Sudoku), but may vary (e.g., 4 or 6).\n2. Each row, each column, and each designated subgrid (box) must contain all digits from 1 to 9 exactly once.\n3. Empty cells in the puzzle are represented by '0' or '.' — treat them as unknowns to be filled.\n4. Use step-by-step deductive reasoning to determine the correct digit for each empty cell.\n5. Do not output any explanations, comments, thought processes, or formatting beyond the final answer.\n6. Return exactly 9 lines of output.\n7. Each line must contain exactly 9 digits (from 1 to 9), separated by single spaces.\n8. Ensure the completed grid satisfies all Sudoku rules.\n\nPuzzle Input Format:\n- The puzzle is provided below under \"Puzzle:\".\n- Each line represents a row of the grid.\n- Digits are separated by spaces; empty cells are marked as '0' or '.'.\n\nYour Output Format:\n- Only the solved grid.\n- 9 lines.\n- Each line: 9 numbers separated by single spaces.\n- No extra text before or after.\n\nNow solve the following Sudoku puzzle:\n\nPuzzle:\n7 5 . . . . . 8 .\n2 . . . 5 . . . .\n4 . 6 . . 2 . . 7\n9 . . . 8 4 6 . 5\n6 . 4 . . 1 9 . 8\n. . . . 2 . . . .\n. . . 9 . . . 5 .\n. . 9 2 1 5 . 6 3\n. . . . 7 . . . 4",
      "raw_answer": "**Answer:**\n\nThe problem is that the `for` loop that prints the array is inside the `while` loop that reads the file.  \nSo after the first line is read, the program prints the array (which is still empty) and then\ncontinues to the next iteration of the `while` loop.  \nWhen the second line is read, the array is already full, so the `for` loop prints the\nprevious contents again.  \nIn other words, you are printing the array **inside** the file‑reading loop instead of\nafter it has finished.\n\n**Fix**\n\nMove the `for` loop that prints the array outside of the `while` loop (or use a\nseparate method). For example:\n\n```java\nwhile ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n    // read and parse the line, fill the array\n    ...\n}\n\n// After the file has been read completely, print the array\nfor (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    System.out.println(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\nThis way the array is printed only once, after all lines have been processed.",
