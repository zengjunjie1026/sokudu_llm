2025-11-21 16:45:39.899 | INFO     | __main__:evaluate_puzzle:199 - Prompt: You are a reasoning-only assistant operating in a plain text environment. Your task is to solve the given Sudoku puzzle using logical deduction only—no guessing, no external tools, and no reliance on precomputed solutions.

Instructions:
1. The puzzle is a 9×9 grid, where 9 is typically 9 (standard Sudoku), but may vary (e.g., 4 or 6).
2. Each row, each column, and each designated subgrid (box) must contain all digits from 1 to 9 exactly once.
3. Empty cells in the puzzle are represented by '0' or '.' — treat them as unknowns to be filled.
4. Use step-by-step deductive reasoning to determine the correct digit for each empty cell.
5. Do not output any explanations, comments, thought processes, or formatting beyond the final answer.
6. Return exactly 9 lines of output.
7. Each line must contain exactly 9 digits (from 1 to 9), separated by single spaces.
8. Ensure the completed grid satisfies all Sudoku rules.

Puzzle Input Format:
- The puzzle is provided below under "Puzzle:".
- Each line represents a row of the grid.
- Digits are separated by spaces; empty cells are marked as '0' or '.'.

Your Output Format:
- Only the solved grid.
- 9 lines.
- Each line: 9 numbers separated by single spaces.
- No extra text before or after.
